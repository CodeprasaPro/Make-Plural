# Make-Plural
This simple PHP script can identify if a noun is plural or singular.

<h3> How it works </h3>

For an example, (as originally written in the script itself) in a farm, there are three (3) cows, two (2) pigs, four (4) goats and, one (1) German shepherd. 
When a user feeds those data via this script into the system, the script analyzes the number of animals and, 
considers the animal's name that is more than one 'plural' by appending an 's' to the end of the noun.  
Also it gives a total number of units according to the data the user fed.

<h3> Why it is </h3>

This is a testing project to learn and sharpen the knowledge of PHP, and, also it is still being written and enhanced
to use in the near future. 

<h3> Next step </h3>

As the next step of the project, i am planning to use this simple script in a real world web project since this script still exists as an isolated PHP script 
confining in a local web server testing. 

<h3> Some Screen Shots </h3>
